# How to do some tests

To do some tests use the .bat files: <br/>
- "startMainServer.bat" start the main server. <br />
- "startServerMap1.bat" start the map (only 1 map at moment) <br />
- "startClient.bat" start the client <br />
- "StartDefaultTest-2Players.bat" start two servers and two players. <br />
(to make these batch files work you have to update the bat files with the correct path of your Unreal Engine installation then it will works) <br/>
