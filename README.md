# download content separately (need to work)
(StarterContent) <br />
The repository lacks the "StarterContent" folder in the / Content / StarterContent path

You should add this way to the editor: <br />
Go to "Add new" in the content browser - "Add feature or content pack" - choose the starter content

(ArbitraryStudio) <br />
The repos also lacks a free template folder, downloadable here:<br />
https://gumroad.com/l/uPXbQ <br />
(to add in the "content" folder of the project)

------

(InfinityBladeEffects) <br />
downloadable from the marketplace

to do some tests start use the .bat files "startClient" and "startServer". <br />
(you just have to update the bat files with the correct path of your Unreal Engine installation then it will work properly)
